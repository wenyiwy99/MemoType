I will give you a question, a reference answer, and a response from a model. Please answer [[yes]] if the response contains the reference answer. Otherwise, answer [[no]]. 
If the response is equivalent to the correct answer or contains all the intermediate steps to get the reference answer, you should also answer [[yes]]. If the response only contains a subset of the information required by the answer, answer [[no]].
